				<h1>A Modest Proposal</h1>
				<h3>A proposal, they say, intends to give new ideas, to give birth to a new generation of thinking.
				<br>With our own proposal however, we beg to differ.</h3>

				<h1>We speak for many as they cannot speak for themselves.</h1>
				<p>We, the students, have long persisted in our search for the betterment of our school. Sometimes our voices have been heard, 
				other times however, our voice just comes back at us as if we were talking to a wall. With that we present to you our own proposal
				in the form of comics. With this we intend to revolutionize the school system and to bring a different perspective to it and bring it into a dark spotlight. Well then, let's get reading shall we?</p>
